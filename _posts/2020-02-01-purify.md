During my PhD at UCL I developed distributed astronomy image reconstruction software called Purify.
Purify was developed while performing research on developing algorithms that can leverage sparsity priors to correct artifacts in images from radio telescopes.

There are two core features to the software. The first is to model the instrumentation of the telescope. The second is to apply the optimization algorithm and wavelet transforms (see SOPT).
