### Repository: [Building and Road Segmentation](https://github.com/Luke-Pratley/building_road_segmentation)
Humanitarian and natural disasters can impact roads and buildings, and having a tool that can quickly survey them is useful.
For this reason, I extract buildings and road networks from satellite images using Tensorflow and UNet archtectures.

Key Tools:
- Python
- Tensorflow + Keras
- Pytest
