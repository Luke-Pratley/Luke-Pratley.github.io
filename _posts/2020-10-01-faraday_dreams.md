**Key Tools**: Python, Convex Optimization, Bayesian Analysis

I built a python package that leverages signal processing (e.g., Non-Uniform FFT and Wavelets) and sparsity to probe magnetic fields in the Milky Way and the Universe.
The results are applied in two published studies:
[Removing non-physical structure in fitted Faraday rotated signals: non-parametric QU-fitting](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASA...38...60P/abstract), PASA, L. Pratley and M. Johnston-Hollitt, and B. M. Gaensler, 2021
[Wide-band Rotation Measure Synthesis](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...894...38P/abstract), ApJ, L. Pratley, M. Johnston-Hollitt, 2020
